## <div align="center">üêß Linux</div>

<div align="center">

Linux is a free and open-source operating system that is widely used in bioinformatics. It's a powerful tool for running bioinformatics pipelines and analysis. Most bioinformatics tools are available for Linux only, and it's a good idea to learn it.

Learning Linux includes:

Basic commands, File system, Shell scripting, Package management, Text Processing and Process management.

## <div align="center">üìì Documentation</div>

<div align="center">

Code documentation is a crucial part of any bioinformatics project. It helps you understand the code and how it works, and it's also a great way to share your work with others. Documentation is almost always written in a markup language. Markup languages are designed to structure and format text-based documents, making them more understandable and presentable.

`Markdown` is a lightweight markup language designed to be easy to read and write while allowing for rich text formatting. It's widely used for documentation, README files, and note-taking. Its simple syntax allows you to create formatted text using plain text characters, making it ideal for version control systems.
</div>

Common uses in bioinformatics:

- Documentation for analysis pipelines
- `README` files for code repositories
- `Jupyter`/`R Markdown` notebooks with **`Quarto`**
- Scientific and Code documentation

### <div align="center"> üíº Project Tracking</div>

<div align="center">

Project tracking is a crucial part of any bioinformatics project. It helps you keep track of your tasks, issues, and progress. The main tools for project tracking are issue trackers like `Jira`, `GitHub Issues`. They allow you to create tasks, assign them to team members, and track their progress.

## <div align="center"> ‚ôªÔ∏è Code environments and containers</div>

<div align="center">

Code environments and containers are a crucial part of any bioinformatics project. They allow you to create a reproducible environment for your code and data.

Each project you are working on should have its own environment and container. 

Its dependencies should be managed by the environment manager and a "requirements" file should be always available as a `pyproject.toml` for `python` projects, `renv.lock` for `R` projects, `environment.yml` for `conda` environments, `Dockerfile` for `docker` images and `Singularity` for `apptainer` images.

All these files keep track of the dependencies of the project (environmetn variables, installed packages, system packages, etc) which are needed to recreate the environment and container to run the project reproducibly.

## <div align="center"> ü§ñ Workflows</div>

<div align="center">

Workflows are a crucial part of any bioinformatics project. They allow you to automate your analysis and make it reproducible.

After you tested out your tools you are going to use for your analysis, you created your custom code and you packaged everything into their corresponding containers, you need to put all these pieces together into a workflow.
