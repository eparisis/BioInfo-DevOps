# Nextflow

Nextflow is a industry standard workflow management system that enables scalable and reproducible scientific workflows using software containers. 

It enables you to write workflows in a way that is easy to understand, easy to maintain and easy to deploy locally, in the cloud or in a HPC cluster.

## nf-core

`nf-core` is a community-led framework for building and sharing bioinformatics pipelines.

`nf-core` provides a whole framework for building pipelines, including:

- A set of best practices for building pipelines
- A set of modules and subworkflows for building pipelines
- A set of community-maintained pipelines
- A toolkit for building pipelines `nf-core/tools` which includes:
  - Templates for building pipelines
  - Test Datasets for testing pipelines
  - Code linting and formatting
  - Helper functions for input and output validation
  - Code test guidelines for modules, subworkflows and pipelines.
  - CI tooling through GitHub Actions
